const text = `The Nordic Museum is Sweden’s largest museum of cultural history. An everyday palace, and a place of stories about the life and people of the Nordic region – yesterday, today and tomorrow. Discover clothes and fashion, textiles and jewellery, homes and furniture, photography, toys, folk art, glass and porcelain. There is also an exhibition about the only indigenous people in Sweden, the Sami.

# The building

The museum was founded back in 1873 by Artur Hazelius. The imposing building on Djurgården island – a sight in itself – was designed in Renaissance style by Isak Gustaf Clason, and opened in 1907.`;
