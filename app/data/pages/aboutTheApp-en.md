## Audio Content
The audio content in the app has been recorded over at least twenty years. Recent additions have been recorded by Eskimo Avenue and H Olsson Ord & Vision with Robert Ziherl as project manager at the Nordic Museum. The highlights are produced by H Olsson Ord & Vision together with project managers Lena Landerberg and Robert Ziherl at the Nordic Museum.

The music in the app is from the musical history collection *Musica Sveciae* which is administrated by The Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

## The App
The Nordic Museum Audio Guide has been developed together with the Innovation Studio at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, USA. The app is an expanded and modified version of the Warhol Museum’s app Warhol Out Loud. Both apps are released as open source.
